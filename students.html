    <h1>
        The Students
    </h1>
    <p class="desc">At Perry Meridian High School, there is an incredible diversity of students. They range from different cultures, different capabilities, different interests, and so much more. However, when it comes to those that enter the bathrooms, they are bound to be put in one of these few categories.</p>
    
    <p class="warning">
        These may in fact apply to both the men and women bathrooms!
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Normal and Witnesses
    </h2>
    <p>
        These students are most likely the most favorable. By the name given, it is pretty obvious that they use the bathroom for its actual purpose! These students walk into the bathroom, go into a stall, use the toilet, wash their hands, and walk back to class. However, there are moments they walk into catastrophe.
        <br>When they do, they either:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pull A 360, Walk Right Out, and Found Another Bathroom</li>
        <li>Walk In and Ignore, PRAYING They Don't Get Involved</li>
        <li>Get Involved or Threatened to Not Snitch</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Either way, these students are the best students.
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Disgustings/Devious Lickers
    </h2>
    <p>
        These students are the definition of menace. They are menaces to society and should be removed. These students have many methods to make the bathrooms completely insufferable.
    </p>
    <h3>
        List of Worst Things They HAVE Done
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>WIPE DOOKIE on the Bathroom Walls</li>
        <li>Leave PEE All Over the Toilet Seat</li>
        <li>Leave USED Pads/Blood on the Ground/Toilet/Wall/ETC</li>
        <li>Unflushed of Any Type of DOOKIE in the Toilet</li>
        <li>Took Stall Doors and Handles to Sinks</li>
        <li>Break the Stall Locks</li>
        <li>Throws Toilet Paper Everywhere</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        The Predators
    </h2>
    <p>
        These students can go in two different ways, but both are with the same purpose:
    <p class="privacy">
        Privacy Breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        These students are the ones that go into the bathroom to do one sole thing:
    </p>
    <p class="privacy">
        Break Your Privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now you may ask: How?
        <br>One: They use the gaping cracks the stalls have to stare into your soul.
        <br>Two: They use a device called a phone to record over or under the stall.
        <br>These apply to urinals as well!
    </p>

    <h2>
        The Vapers and Weeders
    </h2>
    <p>
        These students are very well known. As it is stated in the name, these are the ones that vape and smoke weed. Their ability to not get caught and make the bathroom suffocating is phenomenal. You can definitely be half a hallway away and smell the weed.
